<h1>Privacy Policy – Zently: Expense Tracker</h1>

<p><strong>Expense Data:</strong><br />
Your expenses, categories, and related financial data are stored securely in our database and are accessible only by you through your authenticated account.
</p>

<p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong><br />
Subscription and purchase status is managed via RevenueCat and the Apple App Store. While we track whether you have an active premium subscription, we do not store or process your credit card or payment information directly. All subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store. You can manage or cancel your subscriptions at any time via your Apple ID account settings.

  <li>Data for third-party advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
<p>
Your data is securely stored and processed using industry-standard cloud services (Firebase). We use Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions to ensure that your financial data is encrypted and isolated from other users.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

<ul>
